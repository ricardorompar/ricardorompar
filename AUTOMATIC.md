# Automatic GitHub page refresh

The idea behind this project is to create a dynamic `README.md` page for your personal GitHub.

What it does is basically generate some markdown/HTML using python and it updates the `README.md`. This example in particular uses the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API), which is super easy to use and it refreshes every day using a cron job in GitHub actions.
