Text: Hey HN<p>We loaded a BigQuery dataset of all of Hacker News, every comment, story and user, into camelAI.<p>You can ask questions like:<p>• “When does dang tend to comment during the day?”<p>• “Which domains have gained the most submissions since 2015, year-over-year?”<p>• “How has average comment length changed each January since 2007?”<p>• “Top five users who link to arXiv papers the most.”<p>It&#x27;s behind a log-in to prevent abuse but free to use for 10 messages. No payment info required. We use OpenAI o3 or Claude sonnet 3.7 for the agent which can be really expensive.<p>Would love feedback especially around graph&#x2F;chart quality and o3 vs sonnet. </br>

Text: Hi HN folks, I&#x27;m a co-creator of the Dapr CNCF project and co-founder of Diagrid. Today we announced a free-to-use web app that takes any form of workflow diagram (UML, BPMN, scribble in your favorite drawing tool or even on paper) and generates code that runs in any IDE and that can be deployed to Kubernetes and other container based systems, based on Dapr&#x27;s durable execution workflow engine. This essentially allows you to run durable workflows in minutes and leaves out the guesswork for how to structure, code and optimize a code-first workflow app. I&#x27;m happy for you to give this a try and provide feedback! </br>
