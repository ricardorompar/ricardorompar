Text: Every day, thousands of Cease and Desist letters are issued, telling people to stop what theyâ€™re doing (Looking at you, David Chang). What a bummer!<p>Thatâ€™s why we created: The Continue and Persist Letter. A official-looking legal letter that encourages and uplifts people, one that tells people to keep doing what theyâ€™re doing!

Text: Seeing all the hype around Bolt.new, I decided to give it a try, and within just 30 minutes, I built a fully functional web app for screen sharing.<p>How It Works:<p>- One user opens a room and receives a unique code.<p>- Participants join by simply entering the code to view the shared screen.<p>After that initial build, I moved the project to Cursor to continue iterating and enhancing its features.<p>Github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tonghohin&#x2F;screen-sharing">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tonghohin&#x2F;screen-sharing</a><p>Demo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;share-your-screen.vercel.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;share-your-screen.vercel.app</a> </br>
