        Show HN: I built a system for active note-taking in regular meetings like 1-1s |
    </a>
    By: davnicwil

Text: Hey HN! Like most here regular meetings have always been a big part of my work.<p>Over the years I&#x27;ve learned the value of active note taking in these meetings. Meaning: not minutes, not transcriptions or AI summaries, but <i>me</i> using my brain to actively pull out the key points in short form bullet-like notes, as the meeting is going on, as I&#x27;m talking and listening (and probably typing with one hand). This could be agenda points to cover, any interesting sidebars raised, insights gotten to in a discussion, actions agreed to (and a way to track whether they got done next time!).<p>It&#x27;s both useful just to track what&#x27;s going on in all these different meetings week to week (at one point I was doing about a dozen 1-1s per week, and it just becomes impossible to hold it in RAM) but also really valuable over time when you can look back and see the full history of a particular meeting, what was discussed when, how themes and structure are changing, is the meetings effective, etc.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different tools for taking these notes over the years. All the obvious ones you&#x27;ve probably used too. And I&#x27;ve always just been not <i>quite</i> satisfied with the experience. They work, obviously (it&#x27;s just text based notes at the end of the day) but nothing is first-class for this usecase.<p>So, I decided to build the tool I&#x27;ve always felt I want to use, specifically for regular 1-1s and other types of regular meetings. I&#x27;ve been using it myself and with friends for a while already now, and I think it&#x27;s got to that point where I actually prefer to reach for it over other general purpose note taking tools now, and I want to share it more widely.<p>There&#x27;s a free tier so you can use it right away, in fact without even signing up.<p>If you&#x27;ve also been wanting a better system to manage your notes for regular meetings, give it a go and let me know what you think! </br>
