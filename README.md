        Show HN: MyraOS â€“ My 32-bit operating system in C and ASM (Hack Club project) |
    </a>
    By: dvirbt

<p>
Text: Hi HN, Iâ€™m Dvir, a young developer. Last year, I got rejected after a job interview because I lacked some CPU knowledge. After that, I decided to deepen my understanding in the low level world and learn how things work under the hood. I decided to try and create an OS in C and ASM as a way to broaden my knowledge in this area.<p>This took me on the most interesting ride, where Iâ€™ve learned about OS theory and low level programming on a whole new level.  Iâ€™ve spent hours upon hours, blood and tears, reading different OS theory blogs, learning low level concepts, debugging, testing and working on this project.<p>I started by reading University books and online blogs, while also watching videos.  
Some sources that helped me out were OSDev Wiki (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.osdev.org&#x2F;Expanded_Main_Page" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.osdev.org&#x2F;Expanded_Main_Page</a>), OSTEP (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.cs.wisc.edu&#x2F;~remzi&#x2F;OSTEP" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.cs.wisc.edu&#x2F;~remzi&#x2F;OSTEP</a>), open-source repositories like MellOS and LemonOS (more advanced), DoomGeneric, and some friends that have built an OS before.<p>This part was the longest, but also the easiest. I felt like I understood the theory, but still could not connect it into actual code. Sitting down and starting to code was difficult, but I knew that was the next step I needed to  take! 
I began by working on the bootloader, which is optional since you can use a pre-made one (I switched to GRUB later), but implementing it was mainly for learning purposes and to warm up on ASM. These were my steps after that:<p><pre><code>  1) I started implementing the VGA driver, which gave me the ability to display text.
  2) Interrupts - IDT, ISR, IRQ, which signal to the CPU that a certain event occurred and needs handling (such as faults, hardware connected device actions, etc).
  3) Keyboard driver, which enables me to display the same text I type on my keyboard.
  4) PMM (Physical memory management)
  5) Paging and virtual memory management
  6) RTC driver - clock addition (which was, in my opinion, optional)
  7) PIT driver - Ticks every certain amount of time, and also  
  8) FS (File System) and physical HDD drivers - for the HDD I chose PATA (HDD communication protocol) for simplicity (SATA is a newer but harder option as well).
     For the FS I chose EXT2 (The Second Extended FileSystem), which is a foundational linux FS structure introduced in 1993. This FS structure is not the simplest,
     but is very popular in hobby-OS, it is very supported, easy to set up and upgrade to newer EXT versions, it has a lot of materials online, compared to other
     options. This was probably the longest and largest feature I had worked on.
  9) Syscall support.
  10) Libc implementation.
  11) Processing and scheduling for multiprocessing.
  12) Here I also made a shell to test it all.
</code></pre>
At this point, I had a working shell, but later decided to go further and add a GUI! I was working on the FS (stage 8), when I heard about Hack Clubâ€™s Summer of Making (SoM). This was my first time practicing in HackClub, and I want to express my gratitude and share my enjoyment of participating in it.<p>At first I just wanted to declare the OS as finished after completing the FS, and a bit of other drivers, but because of SoM my perspective was changed completely. Because of the competition, I started to think that I needed to ship a complete OS, with processing, GUI and the bare minimum ability to run Doom. I wanted to show the community in SoM how everything works.<p>Then I worked on it for another 2 months, after finishing the shell, just because of SoM!,  totalling my project to almost 7 months of work. At this time I added full GUI support, with dirty rectangles and double buffering, I made a GUI mouse driver, and even made a full Doom port! things I would&#x27;ve never even thought about without participating in SoM.<p>This is my SoM project: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;summer.hackclub.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;5191" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;summer.hackclub.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;5191</a>.<p>Every project has challenges, especially in such a low level project. I had to do a lot of debugging while working on this, and it is no easy task. I highly recommend using GDB which helped me debug so many of my problems, especially memory ones.<p>The first major challenge I encountered was during the coding of processes - I realized that a lot of my paging code was completely wrong, poorly tested, and had to be reworked. During this time I was already in the competition and it was difficult keeping up with devlogs and new features while fixing old problems in a code I wrote a few months ago.<p>Some more major problems occurred when trying to run Doom, and unlike the last problem, this was a disaster. I had random PFs and memory problems, one run could work while the next one wouldnâ€™t, and the worst part is that it was only on the Doom, and not on processes I created myself. These issues took a lot of time to figure out. I began to question the Doom code itself, and even thought about giving up on the whole project.<p>After a lot of time spent debugging, I fixed the issues. It was a combination of scheduling issues, Libc issues and the Qemu not having enough (wrongfully assuming 128MB for the whole OS was enough).<p>Finally, I worked throughout all the difficulties, and shipped the project! In the end, the experience working on this project was amazing. I learned a lot, grew and improved as a developer, and I thank SoM for helping to increase my motivation and make the project memorable and unique like I never imagined it would be.<p>The repo is at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dvir-biton&#x2F;MyraOS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dvir-biton&#x2F;MyraOS</a>. Iâ€™d love to discuss any aspect of this with you all in the comments! </br>
