Text: Hi all,<p>Tom Howard is going public as HN moderator today. He has been doing HN moderation work for years already and knows the site and its practices inside-out, so the only new thing you&#x27;ll see is mod comments from Tom showing up in the threads the way mine do. I&#x27;m not going anywhere, so you&#x27;ll have two of us to put up with going forward :)<p>I&#x27;ve known Tom since he was sctb&#x27;s and my batchmate back in YC W09. Many of you know him as the kind and thoughtful community member tomhoward (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=tomhoward">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=tomhoward</a>). He&#x27;s still kind and thoughtful, but he&#x27;s going to post as tomhow from now on (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=tomhow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=tomhow</a>), the same way I switched to dang when I went through this rite of passage years ago.<p>Below is a bit from Tom about himself. Please join me in welcoming him to this new status which he was crazy enough to say yes to!<p>---<p><i>YC and HN have been a huge part of my life for nearly two decades. I read pg&#x27;s essay How to Start a Startup in 2005 after my friend (and later, co-founder) Fenn found it on Slashdot, and it opened our eyes as to how to go about building products and companies. I first signed up in late 2007, and since then HN has been the place I come to find interesting news and discussions.</i><p><i>Hacker News gave me a window into the big wide world of technology and startups, that had previously seemed so remote and opaque from where I lived (and still live) in Australia. We were lucky enough to be accepted into the W09 batch of YC, and since then HN has been a place where we could share announcements about the startup, but also where I could share the challenges and struggles I experienced in the startup journey and other aspects of life, particularly to do with health and wellbeing.</i><p><i>From the discussions that have happened about these topics I&#x27;ve ended up making enduring friendships with people all over the world, and have been able to learn many things that have improved my life in profound ways. I love HN&#x27;s ethos - of being a place people come to engage their curiosity. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s always been for me and what I hope I can help it to be for everyone!</i><p><i>--Tom</i> </br>
