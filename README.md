Text: I was at FB&#x2F;Meta from late 2013 to early 2023, mostly working in the compiler&#x2F;runtime spaces. I got hit in the spring 2023 layoff wave. I immediately started making games in my newfound free time (a lifelong interest, and I even worked in AA(A?) back ca. ~2000), and in October 2023 I stumbled upon the idea of a roguelike pachinko&#x2F;plinko game inspired by Luck Be A Landlord. Things snowballed quickly, I started talking to publishers, then worked like crazy through all of 2024, almost the hardest I&#x27;ve ever worked in my career, and launched the game in December 2024. It&#x27;s sold ~200,000 units in its first 10 weeks on Steam. So it&#x27;s no Balatro, but I&#x27;d still say it did very well :) AMA?<p>(my game is Ballionaire: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;app&#x2F;2667120&#x2F;view&#x2F;526461473225965590" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;app&#x2F;2667120&#x2F;view&#x2F;5264614...</a>) </br>
