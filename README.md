        Show HN: Term.everything – Run any GUI app in the terminal |
    </a>
    By: mmulet
</li>

<p>
Text: I made a built-from scratch Wayland Compositor to display any GUI app* in the terminal! I think there is a lot of unexplored potential in custom Wayland compositors, a lot of really cool things you can embed existing applications into! So, I started with embedding apps into the terminal because that is the easiest input&#x2F;output (output is just utf-8 and I use the great `chafa` library for that, and I just read from stdin for the input).<p>If you have any other ideas for cool Wayland compositors, let me know. I purposedly wrote 80% the app in Typescript to appeal to the most developers and attract cool contributions (I do all drawing with the familiar Canvas2D api, so if there is interest, I can also fork this out into a cool Terminal canvas, let me know!)<p>I have a blog post here about how I did it, but it’s pretty high level and non technical, so please ask if you have any questions.<p>[How I Did It](&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mmulet&#x2F;term.everything&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;resources&#x2F;HowIDidIt.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mmulet&#x2F;term.everything&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;resource...</a>&gt;)<p>*technically only Wayland apps and x11 apps with Xwayland. But on Linux that’s mostly everything. </br>
