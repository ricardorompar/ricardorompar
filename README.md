Text: Hello HN,
I hope it will posted as well.
I made a note in single html file.
This does not require a separate membership or installation of the software, and if you download and modify an empty file, you can modify and read it at any time, regardless of online or offline.
It can be shared through messengers such as Telegram, so it is also suitable to share contents with long articles and images. 
It is also possible to host and blog because it is static html file content. </br>
