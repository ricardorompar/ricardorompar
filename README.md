Text: Hi everyone, I&#x27;m kinda involved in some retrogaming and with some experiments I ran into the following question: &quot;It would be possible to run transformer models bypassing the cpu&#x2F;ram, connecting the gpu to the nvme?&quot;<p>This is the result of that question itself and some weekend vibecoding (it has the linked library repository in the readme as well), it seems to work, even on consumer gpus, it should work better on professional ones tho </br>
