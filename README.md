        Show HN: Ten years of running every day, visualized |
    </a>
    By: friggeri
</li>

<p>
Text: Today marks ten years, 3653 consecutive days, of running at least one mile every day under the USRSA rules [1]. To celebrate, I built an interactive dashboard that turns a decade of GPX files into charts you can explore.<p>Running has truly changed my life: I&#x27;ve made lifelong friends, explored beautiful places, and more importantly invested into my own health and fitness, which I&#x27;m starting to see the positive benefits as I get older.<p>The stack is pretty simple: a NextJS app, with a Postgres database to keep all my running data, and all the stats are pre-computed and cached in Redis, so I effectively only hit the database once a day when a new run is ingested. On the fronted, I toyed with the idea of using D3 or pre-existing data viz libraries, but ended up rolling my own using SVGs directly, it gave me more control on the visualizations.<p>I used the Strava bulk export to pre-populate the database, and I&#x27;m using their webhook API to do incremental updates. I have to tap into OpenWeatherMap and OpenCageDate to enrich the running data a little bit.<p>Happy to answer anything about the stack, data pipeline, or how I stayed motivated for 10 years!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.runeveryday.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.runeveryday.com</a> Run Streak Association rules: â‰¥ 1 mile per day </br>
