Text: Hello HN,<p>I&#x27;m Paras Chopra, founder of VWO. We&#x27;re an A&#x2F;B testing platform that was born here as a Show HN in 2009: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=876141">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=876141</a><p>Today, I sold the company to a private equity firm for $200mn.<p>It&#x27;s covered on TechCrunch: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2025&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;everstone-acquires-bootstrapped-indian-startup-wingify-for-200m&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2025&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;everstone-acquires-bootstr...</a><p>I was a 22 year old fresh graduate when I launched VWO on HN and got initial users. Feedback from people like @patio11 helped me get to PMF.

I honestly don&#x27;t think I would have been an entrepreneur had it not been for hacker news.<p>Every single day, HN is the first website I open! I&#x27;m feeling very grateful towards the community. Thanks @dang, and thank you Paul Graham for your essays and for creating this beautiful corner of the internet! </br>
