        Show HN: Claude Code recipes for knowledge workers |
    </a>
    By: sgharlow

<p>
Text: I&#x27;ve been using Claude Code daily for about 6 months. After building the same prompts over and over, I started documenting them as &quot;recipes&quot; - structured prompts with context about when to use them and what output to expect.<p>This repo has 100 recipes covering common knowledge work tasks:<p><pre><code>  - Meeting notes → action items
  - Status reports
  - Performance reviews
  - Proposals and presentations
  - Data analysis narratives
  - SOPs and documentation
</code></pre>
Each recipe includes:<p><pre><code>  - The problem it solves
  - When to use it (and when not to)
  - Prerequisites
  - Step-by-step prompts
  - Example output
  - Troubleshooting tips
</code></pre>
The recipes are organized into 10 tiers from universal tasks (everyone needs meeting notes help) to specialized functions (M&amp;A due diligence, legal research).<p>I also included 10 sample slash commands in the &#x2F;premium folder that you can install directly into Claude Code&#x27;s ~&#x2F;.claude&#x2F;commands&#x2F; directory.<p>Happy to answer questions about how these evolved or discuss the patterns I&#x27;ve noticed in what makes prompts work well for different task types. </br>
