<h2>Projects and ideas</h2>
Projects...
<ul>
  <li>ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on different projects like the <a href="https://github.com/ricardorompar/ricardorompar/blob/main/automate.py">automation</a> of this page, and some demos <a href="https://github.com/ricardorompar/boundary-ansible-demo">like this one</a>.
  </li>

  <li >A few months back I began my <a href="https://github.com/ricardorompar/cloudResumeChallenge">Cloud Resume Challenge</a> (and haven't yet finished). It's a web-based resume that helps you practice different technologies and tools like the cloud, infrastructure as code, continuous integration, versioning, etc. If you want to learn more visit <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/" target="_blank">check this out</a>.
  </li>

  <li>ðŸ”­ <a href="https://github.com/ricardorompar/capstoneT2">This</a> is the capstone (integration) project for the second term of the master in Computer Science. It is a basic 3-tier app that allows users to access, modify and create stock a portfolio of their favorite stocks.

        Show HN: Dayflow â€“ A git log for your day |

<p>
Text: Hi HN! I&#x27;ve been building Dayflow, a macOS app that automatically tracks what you&#x27;re actually working on (not just which apps you have open).<p>Here&#x27;s what it does:<p>- It creates a semantic timeline of your day;<p>- It does it by understanding the content on your screen (with local or cloud VLMs);<p>- This allows you to see exactly where your time went without any manual logging.<p>Traditional time trackers tell you &quot;3 hours in Chrome&quot; which is not very helpful. Dayflow actually understands if you&#x27;re reading documentation, debugging code, or scrolling HN. Instead of &quot;Chrome: 3 hours&quot;, you get &quot;Reviewed PR comments: 45min&quot;, &quot;Read HN thread about Rust: 20min&quot;, &quot;Debugged auth flow: 1.5hr&quot;.<p>I was an early Rewind user but rarely used the retrieval feature. I built Dayflow because I saw other interesting uses for screen data. I find that it helps me stay on track while working - I check it every few hours and make sure Iâ€™m spending my time the way I intended - if Iâ€™m not, I try to course correct.<p>Hereâ€™s what you need to know about privacy:<p>- Run 100% locally using qwen2.5-vl-3b (~4GB model)<p>- No cloud uploads, no account<p>- Full source available under MIT license (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JerryZLiu&#x2F;Dayflow" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JerryZLiu&#x2F;Dayflow</a>)<p>- Optional: BYO Gemini API key for better quality (stored in Keychain, with free-tier workaround to prevent training on your data)<p>The tech stack is pretty simple, SwiftUI with a local sqlite DB. Uses native macOS apis for efficient screen captures. Since most people who run LLMs locally already have their tool of choice (Ollama, LLMStudio, etc.), I decided to not embed an LLM into Dayflow.<p>By far the biggest challenge was adapting from SOTA vision models like Gemini 2.5 Pro to small, local models. My constraints were that it had to take up &lt;4GB of ram and have vision capabilities. I had to do a lot of evals to figure out that Qwen2.5VL-3B was the best balance of size and quality, but there was still a sizable tradeoff in quality that I had to accept. I also got creative with sampling rates and prompt chunking to deal with the 100x smaller context window. Processing a 15 minute segment takes ~32 local LLM calls vs 2 Gemini calls!<p>Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m working on next:<p>Distillation: Using Gemini&#x27;s high-quality outputs as training data to teach a local model the patterns it needs, hopefully closing the quality gap.<p>Custom dashboards where you can track answers to any question like &quot;How long did I spend on HN?&quot; or &quot;Hours until my first deep work session of the day<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts, especially if you&#x27;ve struggled with productivity tracking or have ideas for what you&#x27;d want from a tool like this. </br>
