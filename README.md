Text: Hi! I&#x27;m Jax and I&#x27;ve been building this cool little terminal app for myself to track my expenses and budgets!<p>Other than challenging myself to learn Python, I built this mainly around the habit of budget tracking at the end of the day. (I tried tracking on-the-go, but the balance was always out of sync.) All data is stored in a single sqlite file, so you can export and process them all you want!<p>The app is built using the textual API for Python! Awesome framework which feels like I&#x27;m doing webdev haha.<p>You can check out some screenshots on gh: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EnhancedJax&#x2F;Bagels">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EnhancedJax&#x2F;Bagels</a><p>Thanks! </br>
