Text: Hello everyone, I would like to see if there is any interest in this little project that I have been working on for the past few years.<p>Could be relevant, seeing the direction in which the mainstream game engines are going.<p>I didn&#x27;t really like any of the already existing options, so I tried to make my own and it turned out to be easier than expected.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like a low-budget Unreal&#x2F;Source, but with open-world streaming support and it is free and open source. Very old-school. But optimized for more modern hardware. Very fast too.<p>Still not production ready, but it seems like it is mostly working.<p>I want to finish a few larger projects with it to see what happens.<p>Btw, the name is probably temporary. </br>
