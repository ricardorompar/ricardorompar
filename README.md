        Show HN: Nissan's Leaf app doesn't have a home screen widget so I made my own |

Text: Nissan&#x27;s official mobile app for their LEAF electric car doesn&#x27;t have a widget for quickly checking the car&#x27;s battery charge status on your phone&#x27;s home screen, so for a fun side project I decided to make my own using free tools like GitHub Actions, Appium, Tailscale, and Apple Shortcuts. </br>

Text: I recently brought Infocom&#x27;s original UNIX z-machine source code back to life on modern systems. The modified source code, instructions on usage, a build of the z-machine, and examples of embedded game executables are available.<p>There is also a detailed write-up about the state of the original source code, the porting process, and the invaluable role Justine Tunney&#x27;s Cosmpolitan project played in bringing the Zork trilogy (and more) to Windows&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;bsd for arm&#x2F;x86 machines over the course of a lazy Sunday. </br>
