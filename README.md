        Show HN: I completed shipping my desktop app |

Text: Hi, I&#x27;m a developer and first time i shipped the real product after observing the startups and indie hackers community for years.<p>I had made so many useless apps [you should check my website <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ansh.life" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ansh.life</a>], but this time I built a very useful product that has a number of super easy-to-use tools in one app for video, music, and photo files. Users can compress, convert, resize, and do so much more with easy-to-use tools.<p>Background: I developed a frame-by-frame video cropper to upload cropped landscape videos to Instagram Reels. However, it required FFmpeg, and as a noob video editor, I decided to incorporate more user-friendly video tools. I then introduced image and audio tools to maximize the capabilities of FFmpeg. I use my app daily, and it has surprisingly generated a few thousand dollars for me. </br>
