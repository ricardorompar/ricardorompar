Text: Hi there! I&#x27;ve been on-and-off working on TacOS for a few months, which follows some UNIX-derived concepts (exec&#x2F;fork, unix-style VFS, etc) and is now able to run a port of Doom, with a fairly small amount of modifications, using my from-scratch libc. The performance is actually decent compared to what I expected. Very interested to hear your thoughts. Thank you! </br>
