        Show HN: Strange Attractors |

<p>
Text: I went down the rabbit hole on a side project and ended up building this: Strange Attractors(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.shashanktomar.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;strange-attractors" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.shashanktomar.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;strange-attractors</a>). Itâ€™s built with three.js.<p>Working on it reminded me of the little &quot;maths for fun&quot; exercises I used to do while learning programming in early days. Just trying things out, getting fascinated and geeky, and being surprised by the results. I spent way too much time on this, but it was extreme fun.<p>My favorite part: someone pointed me to the Simone Attractor on Threads. It is a 2D attractor and I asked GPT to extrapolate it to 3D, not sure if itâ€™s mathematically correct, but itâ€™s the coolest by far. I have left all the params configurable, so give it a try. I called it Simone (Maybe).<p>If you like math-art experiments, check it out. Would love feedback, especially from folks who know more about the math side. </br>

        Futurelock: A subtle risk in async Rust |
    </a>
    By: bcantrill

<p>
Text: This RFD describes our distillation of a really gnarly issue that we hit in the Oxide control plane.[0]  Not unlike our discovery of the async cancellation issue[1][2][3], this is larger than the issue itself -- and worse, the program that hits futurelock is correct from the programmer&#x27;s point of view.  Fortunately, the surface area here is smaller than that of async cancellation and the conditions required to hit it can be relatively easily mitigated.  Still, this is a pretty deep issue -- and something that took some very seasoned Rust hands quite a while to find.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oxidecomputer&#x2F;omicron&#x2F;issues&#x2F;9259" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oxidecomputer&#x2F;omicron&#x2F;issues&#x2F;9259</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rfd.shared.oxide.computer&#x2F;rfd&#x2F;397" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rfd.shared.oxide.computer&#x2F;rfd&#x2F;397</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rfd.shared.oxide.computer&#x2F;rfd&#x2F;400" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rfd.shared.oxide.computer&#x2F;rfd&#x2F;400</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zrv5Cy1R7r4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zrv5Cy1R7r4</a> </br>
