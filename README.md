        Show HN: Time Portal â€“ Get dropped into history, guess where you landed |
    </a>

<p>
Text: Hi HN! I love imagining the past, so I made Time Portal, a game where you are dropped into a historical event and see AI video footage from that moment. You have to guess where you are in time and on the map. Itâ€™s like GeoGuessr (and heavily inspired by it!) but for historical events.<p>The videos are all created with AI. Itâ€™s a pipeline of Flux (images), Kling (video), and mmaudio (audio). The videos arenâ€™t always historically accurate to the last detail. They might incorporate elements of folklore or have details from popular beliefs about the way things looked rather than the latest academic research on how they looked.<p>Iâ€™m thinking a lot about how to make the game more interactive. One thing that makes Geoguessr so fun for me is that you can move infinitely and always find more details to help you pinpoint the location. I want Time Portal to have a similar quality. I have a few ideas to try soon that will hopefully make the game more interactive and infinite. </br>
