        Show HN: Chawan TUI web browser |
    </a>

<p>
Text: A terminal-based web browser in Nim.[1]  Has acceptable (YMMV) CSS
rendering, some JS support, and inline images (sixel&#x2F;kitty).  It can
also use various protocols other than http(s) such as (s)ftp, gopher,
gemini, ...<p>Chawan started out as a w3m clone, and the UI still resembles it.
However, the architecture has turned out quite different, with pages
loaded in separate processes, and protocol&#x2F;file type handling separated
out into external binaries.  An interesting result is that you can even
register decoders for custom inline image formats, although practical
use cases of this are rather minimal.<p>There is a gallery showcasing some websites being rendered here:

        Show HN: Canine â€“ A Heroku alternative built on Kubernetes |
    </a>
    By: czhu12
</li>

<p>
Text: Hello HN!<p>I&#x27;ve been working on Canine for about a year now. It started when I was sick of paying the overhead of using stuff like Heroku, Render, Fly, etc to host some web apps that I&#x27;ve built. At one point I was paying over $400 a month for hosting these in the cloud. Last year I moved all my stuff to Hetzner.<p>For a 4GB machine, the cost of various providers:<p>Heroku = $260
Fly.io = $65
Render = $85
Hetzner = $4<p>(This problem gets a lot worse when you need &gt; 4GB)<p>The only downside of using Hetzner is that there isnâ€™t a super straightforward way to do stuff like:<p>- DNS management &#x2F; SSL certificate management
- Team management
- Github integration<p>But I figured it should be easy to quickly build something like Heroku for my Hetzner instance. Turns out it was a bit harder than expected, but after a year, Iâ€™ve made some good progress<p>The best part of Canine, is that it also makes it trivial to host any helm chart, which is available for basically any open source project, so everything from databases (e.g. Postgres, Redis), to random stuff like torrent tracking servers, VPNâ€™s endpoints, etc.<p>Open source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;czhu12&#x2F;canine">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;czhu12&#x2F;canine</a>
