Text: I&#x27;ll be here for the next 3 hours and then again at around 4 pm EST for another 3 hours. As usual, there are many possible topics and I&#x27;ll be guided by whatever you&#x27;re concerned with but as much as possible - because we&#x27;ve received so many questions about this the past few months - I&#x27;d like to focus on the impact of the new administration on U.S. immigration law and policy. Please remember that I can&#x27;t provide legal advice on specific cases for liability reasons because I won&#x27;t have access to all the facts. Please stick to a factual discussion in your questions and comments and I&#x27;ll try to do the same in my answers. Thanks!<p>Edit: Thank you again for the great questions and discussion. I&#x27;m taking a break now and will return in about an hour. If I miss any questions before the AMA ends today, I&#x27;ll do my best to respond tomorrow </br>
